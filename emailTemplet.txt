GAME SUMMARIES



OG NRFI MODEL -  This basically takes 1-6 of every lineup and runs season long hitter numbers against a blend of pitchers 1st inning stats, pitchers LHB or RHB splits, and pitchers home/away splits per if the hitter is a lefty or righty and where the game is being played... The model then takes the probabilities of each outcome and adds it. Then it adds them all for top 6 hitters in the lineup. If we dont have an actual lineup posted yet the lineup used is from our lineup prediction service. This basically takes the run exp of each of those 6 hitters and add them together... for example shohei might count as .21898 expected runs for a pitcher while kike hernandez might only be worth .0345324... All of these are added up for both teams and then we use the number to calc probability of one of the teams to score (team a +team b) - (team a*team b)...

I find this model is higher on the % chance of YRFI number but if you are willing to take anything under like 60% chance and pair this with our pitchers trends have seen some good results.



NRFI SIMULATION MODEL - This model basically takes similar stats from lineups and pitchers however it runs a simulation on the first inning of each game 1000x and counts how many times each team scored in the first inning then uses that for the probability of each team and finds the probability that one of them score... Again pair this with SP trends.



DFS STUFF - Looks at every player who's team plays today and gets the stats of every hitter for their season totals and the hitters stats in the last 7 days... This attempts to find trends if a hitter is outpreforming his season stats. The number to the left of the players is the % increase or decrease his last 7 days worth of stats are in comparison to his season numbers, specifically its looking at AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS - requires a hitter to have 15 AB in the last 7 days I believe is the threshold. Its basically a composite score of sBA+, sOBP+, sSLG+, sOPS+ except its using 0 as the +/- threshold rather than 100. KEY TO REMEMBER: this outperformance % is relative to the hitters own self...The better the season the hitter is having the harder it is for that players outpreformance score to be super high. So its possible that altuve at -5% could still be better than +13%  Zack Gelof. The idea behind the +/- is that we need to find VALUE in dfs. 


SP MATCHUPS - HOT/COLD trend: Looks at pitchers season stats and compares them to the pitchers last28 days stats, essentially is creating a sOVA+, sBIPBA+, sOBP+, sSLG+ against their own baseline and then coming to a conclusion if the pitcher is outpreforming their year stats and is essentially "hot" right now, same goes for "cold". Matchups: looks at SP season stats and last28 days worth of stats.. it blends these stats with a 60% weight on season long. 40% weight on their last 28 days. This gets us a number of stats and then we compare them and calculate them to the opposing starting pitcher relative to each other. There diff stats/data points we compare between the two pitchers that are weighted below. Open to input to what these weights should be but so far this sorta passes the eye test to me today.

weights:
        {"AB/R", 1},
        {"AB/H", 1},
        {"PA/HR", 1},
        {"AB/SB", .01},
        {"SB/SB+CS", 0.5},// Lower is better
        {"PA/BB", 1},
        {"AB/SO", 0.5},// Lower is better
        {"SOW", 0.5},
        {"BA", 1},  // Lower is better
        {"OBP", 1}, // Lower is better
        {"SLG", 1}, // Lower is better
        {"OPS", 1}, // Lower is better
        {"PA/TB", 1},
        {"AB/GDP", 0.5},
        {"BAbip", 1}, // Lower is better
        {"tOPSPlus", 1},
        {"sOPSPlus", 1}





SB PROP BEST BETS- There is a lot to be said if a pitcher should be held responsible for stolen bases or if the catcher is responsible. Argument is pretty strong that base stealing success is more dependent on the pitcher than catcher when every mlb catcher is between 1.8to 1.95 pop time, but pitchers delivery to home plate can vary at a much larger range to where he can actually give his catcher the chance to throw out the runner, or if hes slow enough, the best catcher in the league still wont have a chance. This SB prop picker basically looks through the pitchers for today, finds the ones that have given up the most stolen bases as well as CS% and then goes to the lineup (or predicted lineup) and finds the top base stealers in the lineup.. There is no pretty print of output yet but the way I like to play this is if one pitcher gives up successful SB at a high number or rate and the lineup has multiple good basestealers, I will take at least 2 of the base stealers in the lineup that are most likely to be successful and bet equal units on both. General SB prop odds are +200-+350 so if just one of the two base stealers is successful it will pay for both bets and profit.
